CSE 514A - Programming Assignment 1

The IDE I was using for this was PyCharm

These python files use Python 3.9 or higher as their interpretter. The environment in use will need to have the imported packages at the top of the file being
executed to run properly.

To run each model, navigate to the desired directory and open the python file, and run it.

For the files in the Univariate Analysis Directory, each python file should give you a training scatter plot, testing scatter plot, and the R2 scores in order during
execution. 

The Multivariate Analysis directory contains one python file that outputs the R2 values for the testing data at the end of the files execution.
